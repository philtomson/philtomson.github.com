          <p>I had an interview at a startup downtown this last week. This company has revenue and is selling stuff.  At one point I asked the Director of Engineering: &ldquo;So, is the company profitable?&rdquo;.  Apparently this wasn&rsquo;t the right question to ask.  His response was they weren&rsquo;t trying to be profitable, they were trying to grow.  As I was pondering this later it seemed odd to want growth over profitability.  But apparently in the topsy-turvy world of venture capital funded startups this makes some kind of sense.</p>

<p>But still, I kind of wonder about  this idea of  growth for growth&rsquo;s sake.  Isn&rsquo;t that kind of how cancer works?  Or maybe kind of like the growth caused by high fructose corn syrup?</p>

<p>The thing is, these VC funded startups seem to be getting all the press, whereas companies that aren&rsquo;t obsessed with growth tend to fly completely under the radar.  My wife worked for a small software company for most of the 90&rsquo;s that made scientific visualization software for the Mac.  They primarily sell into Universities &amp; Government research facilities.  It&rsquo;s a small niche, but for the last 20 years or so they&rsquo;ve employed between 5 and 8 software engineers.  They still employ about that many people and probably will for another 10 years or so.  They&rsquo;re not worried about growth, they want sustainability.  And they always seemed to be having a good time.  Most of the people working there have been there for close to 20 years now.  It&rsquo;s interesting, steady work that seems to pay well.   Sure, they could have gone out and tried to get VC to “expand into new markets”&hellip; but it&rsquo;s probable that if they had done that, they wouldn&rsquo;t exist now.  They may have been bought and rolled into a larger company and most of the people working there would have left soon after that or rapid growth could have caused it to crash and burn.  No, instead they&rsquo;ve chosen the sustainable path.  Good on them.</p>
